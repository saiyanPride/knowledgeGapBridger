- This is an attempt to utilise Natural Language processing to decipher search engine results, summarise them and present these summaries to a human user. 
- The motivation is to enable humans to extract all relevant insights, from search engine queries which have an overwhelmingly large number of results ( think thousands, millions etc) in a short time frame. This is vital for problem-solving, where every relevant piece of information is potentially relevant, but the time it'll take a human to survey all search results is beyond his/her lifetime
