- This is an attempt to utilise Natural Language Processing techniques to decipher search engine results, summarise them and present the summaries to a human user
- The motivation is to enable rapid extraction of all relevant insights, from search engine queries which have an overwhelmingly large number of results ( think thousands, millions etc). This is vital for problem-solving, where every relevant piece of information is potentially useful, but the time it'll take a human to digest all search results is beyond the typical human lifetime
